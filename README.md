# Xenium OS Memory Dump

## Introduction
"Xenium OS Memory Dump" is a comprehensive dump of the Xbox memory captured while Xenium OS is actively running. This 25MB dump (which can be optimized for size) offers an unencrypted and uncompressed view into the Xenium OS, opening avenues for exploration and modification.

## Project Purpose
The primary aim of this project is to enable enthusiasts and developers in the Xbox scene to delve into Xenium OS. By providing an unencrypted/uncompressed memory dump, we facilitate a deeper understanding of the OS's workings, allowing for unpacking, modifications, and potential patches.

## Highlights of Our Exploration
Our initial explorations have led to some intriguing discoveries, including:
- Extraction of the hard-coded background introduced in Xenium OS.
- Uncovering some of the Lua Scripts used within the OS.

We're excited to release this dump to the public, encouraging more hands and minds to explore and experiment with it.

## Acknowledgments
- Special thanks to Ryzee119 for invaluable guidance and tips.

## Future Endeavors
The Xbox scene thrives on community-driven, free projects, and we're committed to contributing to this ethos. Stay tuned for our upcoming project, "Prometheos" - a replacement for Xenium OS.
